See who your computer is talking to

This script displays the incoming and outgoing internet traffic to and from your computer on a world map.

This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from [http://www.maxmind.com](http://www.maxmind.com).
Specifically, the script requires the [GeoLite2 City database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) in mmdb format to be in the current working directory.
